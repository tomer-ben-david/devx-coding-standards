# Coding Standards & Conventions

A collection of coding standards and best practices for software development. These conventions are used across multiple projects to ensure consistency, maintainability, and code quality.

## Overview

This repository contains coding conventions and best practices that can be referenced and reused across projects. The standards are organized by language and topic, making it easy to find relevant guidelines for your project.

## General Coding Conventions

See [general-conventions.md](./general-conventions.md) for coding standards that apply to all programming languages. Examples use Swift syntax, but principles are language-agnostic.

## Swift / SwiftUI Conventions

See [swift-conventions.md](./swift-conventions.md) for Swift and SwiftUI-specific patterns and examples. This extends the [general conventions](./general-conventions.md) with Swift-specific syntax and patterns.

## Commit Message Conventions

See [commit-conventions.md](./commit-conventions.md) for commit message standards. We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with `topic()` scope for work-in-progress features (e.g., `feat(topic): experimental feature`).


## Usage

Reference these conventions in your project README:
